## Backdrop-Filter
![Read Me](./images/backdrop-filter.webp)
This applies a filter to the area behind an element, which is also known as the `backdrop`. It can be used to create various visual effects such as blurring, color shifting, and saturation.  

The `backdrop-filter` property is currently supported by most modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge). It is important to note that it can be resource-intensive and may affect the performance of your website if overused or applied to large areas.

```
backdrop-filter: blur(2px);
backdrop-filter: brightness(60%);
backdrop-filter: contrast(40%);
backdrop-filter: drop-shadow(4px 4px 10px blue);
backdrop-filter: grayscale(30%);
backdrop-filter: hue-rotate(120deg);
backdrop-filter: invert(70%);
backdrop-filter: opacity(20%);
backdrop-filter: sepia(90%);
backdrop-filter: saturate(80%);
```
